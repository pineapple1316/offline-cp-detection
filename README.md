# offline-cp-detection
detect whether there exists a change point or not in high-dimensional correlation matrices, if there exists a cp, then estimate its location. 


see the paper 'Li, Z., & Gao, J. (2024). Efficient change point detection and estimation in high-dimensional correlation matrices. Electronic Journal of Statistics, 18(1), 942-979.' for more details.
